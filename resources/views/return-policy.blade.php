		<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#008c94;">RETURN POLICY<br></span>
		The product we produced is customized in nature, thus we do not accept returns. As what was stated above, the artwork/proof being sent to the customer is considered approved after 24 hours upon receipt. Producing the incorrect bracelet size, color, or design on the bands does not entitle a return privilege. In the event that the error occurred on our end, then such order will be reproduced without additional cost.
